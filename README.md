# Stocks-Comparison
A project which extensively compares arms and petroleum stocks on companies which may relay to key events that can take place in the future.
correlationanalysis.ipynb focuses on the analysis of stock returns between certain petroleum and arms companies alongside with gold prices when major events like wars or invasions occur.
Stockanalysis.ipynb focuses on the average stock return of multiple arms and petroleum companies which are considered as huge powerhouses.
scrapingnewsofhighcorrelationdates.ipynb focuses on utilizing news apis and gathering articles on particular dates which were corresponding to the high correlation between petroleum and arms companies.
This research opens area of understanding regarding stock data analysis and its plausibility in predicting events in the future.
I have also tried doing sentiment analysis to check how certain arcticles can effect the stock margins though there was a huge flaw to it as it came to my undersatnding that companied tend to push articles which can be false by nature to control public opninion.

I don't know whether this project may aid in opening a new perspective of reality or not but I believe this can make a few changes to those to have a vision to see.
